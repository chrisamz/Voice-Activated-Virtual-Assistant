# Voice-Activated Virtual Assistant

## Description

The Voice-Activated Virtual Assistant project aims to develop a virtual assistant that can understand and respond to user queries in natural language. By leveraging advanced techniques in natural language processing (NLP), speech recognition, and dialogue systems, the assistant can interact with users effectively and provide relevant responses. This project demonstrates the integration of various machine learning models to create a cohesive and functional voice-activated assistant.

## Skills Demonstrated

- **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Techniques for understanding and processing human language.
- **Speech Recognition:** Converting spoken language into text.
- **Dialogue Systems:** Managing conversations with users to provide relevant and coherent responses.
- **Machine Learning:** Applying machine learning algorithms to improve the performance and capabilities of the assistant.

## Components

### 1. Speech Recognition

Convert spoken language into text using speech recognition models.

- **Techniques Used:** Acoustic modeling, language modeling, feature extraction.
- **Libraries/Tools:** Google Speech-to-Text, CMU Sphinx, DeepSpeech.

### 2. Natural Language Processing (NLP)

Understand and process the text to extract meaning and intent.

- **Techniques Used:** Tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, named entity recognition, sentiment analysis.
- **Libraries/Tools:** NLTK, spaCy, Transformers (BERT, GPT).

### 3. Dialogue Management

Manage the flow of conversation and generate appropriate responses.

- **Techniques Used:** Rule-based systems, retrieval-based models, generative models.
- **Libraries/Tools:** Rasa, Dialogflow, Microsoft Bot Framework.

### 4. Response Generation

Generate coherent and contextually relevant responses to user queries.

- **Techniques Used:** Sequence-to-sequence models, attention mechanisms, transformer models.
- **Libraries/Tools:** OpenAI GPT, T5, BERT.

### 5. Integration

Combine all components into a cohesive system that can interact with users in real-time.

- **Tools Used:** Flask, Docker, cloud services (AWS/GCP/Azure).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or above
- Required libraries listed in `requirements.txt`

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/voice_activated_virtual_assistant.git
   cd voice_activated_virtual_assistant
   ```

2. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Running the Notebooks

1. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

2. Open and run the notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory to develop and test individual components:
   - `speech_recognition.ipynb`
   - `nlp_processing.ipynb`
   - `dialogue_management.ipynb`
   - `response_generation.ipynb`

### Integration

1. Run the integration script to combine all components into a cohesive system:
   ```bash
   python src/integration.py
   ```

2. Interact with the virtual assistant by providing voice input and receiving responses.

## Results and Evaluation

- **Speech Recognition:** Successfully converted spoken language into text with high accuracy.
- **NLP Processing:** Effectively understood and processed natural language queries.
- **Dialogue Management:** Managed conversations and maintained context effectively.
- **Response Generation:** Generated coherent and contextually relevant responses.
